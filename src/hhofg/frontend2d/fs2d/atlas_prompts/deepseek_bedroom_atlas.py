"""Bedroom DeepSeek global atlas prompt."""

BEDROOM_PROMPT_EN = r"""
You are an expert in household-service robot manipulation and operability modeling.

[Task]
Generate a compact “Bedroom Global Operability Atlas (prior)” for a hierarchical functional scene graph.
You must output a strict JSON object containing:

- "objects": bedroom-relevant O entries with their typical functional carriers (C) and interactive units (U).
- "remote_relation_candidates": directed remote functional candidate edges (E_rem).
  Each remote edge MUST include a short functional description field "relation".
- Local functional relationship descriptions MUST be written inline in the O/C/U hierarchy:
  carrier.oc_relation, unit.cu_relation, unit.ou_relation, and direct_unit.ou_relation.

[Definitions]

- O (object): an operability-relevant bedroom entity modeled as a node in the atlas.
  There are TWO kinds of O:
  (A) Directly manipulable objects: must have actionable interfaces.
  (B) Remote endpoint/source objects: may have no local actuators, but can appear as controller/source or target in remote relations
  (e.g., ceiling light, table lamp, power outlet). If an object appears in remote_relation_candidates, it MUST appear in "objects".

  To reduce omissions, think by categories. Examples are not exhaustive:
  - storage furniture: wardrobe, closet, dresser, nightstand, cabinet
  - lighting: ceiling light, table lamp, floor lamp
  - openings: door, window
  - tabletop containers/tools: bottle, jar
  - room infrastructure: switch panel, power outlet

- C (functional carrier): a mid-level structure within an object that organizes interaction and typically hosts one or more U
  (e.g., door, drawer, lid, control panel).
- U (interactive unit): an atomic actuator that can be directly pressed/turned/pulled/pushed/toggled/grasped
  (e.g., handle, knob, button, lever, switch, cap, lid, latch).

- Generic category labels are NOT allowed as object names:
  do NOT use vague classes such as "furniture", "appliance", "device", "equipment", "container", "tool", etc.

[Local vs. Remote — representation rule]

- Local relations (E_loc) are part-of or internal control chains inside one entity, typically O <- C <- U or O <- U.
  Local relations MUST be expressed ONLY via the O/C/U hierarchy inside each object entry:
  "functional_carriers" and "direct_interactive_units".
  Examples:
  - wardrobe/closet <- door <- handle/knob
  - dresser/nightstand/cabinet <- drawer/door <- handle/knob
  - bottle <- cap
  - jar <- lid

- Remote relations (E_rem) are cross-entity functional dependencies WITHOUT part-of containment.
  Remote relations MUST be expressed ONLY via "remote_relation_candidates".
  Examples:
  - ceiling light <- switch panel
  - table lamp <- power outlet
  - floor lamp <- power outlet

=========================
General Constraints (High Priority)
=========================

1. Directly manipulable objects must have actionable interfaces

- For kind (A) objects: include an O only if it has at least one actionable interface:
  functional_carriers is non-empty OR direct_interactive_units is non-empty.
- Exclude entities that are only “grasp-and-move” with no clear actuator or functional interface.
- Examples usually to exclude, unless a clear actuator is visible/annotated:
  bed, pillow, blanket, quilt, mattress, clothes, book, decoration, carpet, rug, wall, floor, ceiling.

2. Remote endpoint/source objects exception

- For kind (B) remote endpoint/source objects, e.g., ceiling light, table lamp, floor lamp, power outlet:
  they may have empty functional_carriers and empty direct_interactive_units.
  However, include them ONLY if they are used as endpoints in remote_relation_candidates.

3. Minimality

- For each O: prefer 0–2 carriers.
- For each carrier: prefer 1–2 interactive units.
- For direct_interactive_units: prefer 1–3 units.
- If unsure whether something is common, omit it.
- Do not guess long-tail or rare parts.

4. Canonical granularity

- Prefer high-frequency, generic, generalizable names.
- Avoid rare or overly specific parts such as "hidden release", "sliding rail", "hinge latch", "battery cover", "cable port".
- Do not invent overly fine-grained carrier names when a simpler carrier is sufficient.

5. Naming

- object / carrier / unit names MUST be lowercase English with spaces.
- Do not use hyphens.
- interactive units should be short generic labels:
  handle, knob, button, lever, switch, cap, lid, latch.
- Avoid fine-grained variants such as "drawer-handle", "door-knob", "lamp-switch", "power-button".
  Use "handle", "knob", "switch", or "button" instead.

6. C / U validity rule

- C must be a structural carrier, not an atomic actuator.
- Allowed C examples: door, drawer, lid, control panel.
- Forbidden C labels: handle, knob, button, lever, switch, cap, latch.
- Do not create a carrier just to host an actuator: if the candidate carrier is an atomic actuator or has the same name as the unit, remove the carrier and attach the unit directly to the object as a direct_interactive_unit.

7. U assignment rule

- Each U must be assigned to the smallest structure it directly acts on or directly controls.
- A U may be placed under a carrier’s interactive_units ONLY if both conditions hold:
  (a) the U physically belongs to that carrier or is mounted on that carrier; AND
  (b) actuating the U directly controls that carrier, e.g., open/close, lock/unlock, turn on/off, adjust.
- Otherwise, if the U is used to manipulate the whole object, grasp/carry/move it, or is not specific to a single carrier,
  then it MUST go to the object’s direct_interactive_units.
- U must be an atomic actuator.
  Do NOT use structural terms as U:
  door, drawer, lid, control panel, wardrobe, closet, dresser, nightstand, cabinet, lamp, window.

=========================
Remote relation candidates (E_rem only; directed edges)
=========================

Add a top-level field "remote_relation_candidates" listing ONLY remote functional relation candidates.

Hard rules:

- Only include plausible remote functional candidates between physically independent entities:
  cross-entity dependencies such as control, trigger, power, or enablement.
- Direction MUST be: target <- controller/source.
  In JSON semantics: to_object <- from_object.
- from_object MUST be the controller/source.
- to_object MUST be the controlled/consumer/affected target.
- Endpoints must be concrete objects, NOT generic category labels.
- Every endpoint string MUST match exactly one "object" name in the "objects" list.
- Do NOT include local part-of relations here.
- Do NOT include purely spatial/structural associations such as support, placement, adjacency, containment, layout, or co-location.
  Forbidden examples:
  - bed <-> nightstand
  - table lamp <-> nightstand
  - wardrobe <-> wall
  - cabinet <-> wall
  - switch panel <-> power outlet
- Keep the remote list compact.

Recommended bedroom remote patterns:

- ceiling light <- switch panel relation: "turn on or off"
- table lamp <- power outlet relation: "provide power"
- floor lamp <- power outlet relation: "provide power"

Remote functional description requirements:

- Each remote relation candidate MUST include a short non-empty "relation".
- Use short action phrases:
  "turn on or off", "provide power".

=========================
Local relation descriptions
=========================

Local functional relationship descriptions MUST be written inline:

- For each carrier C under each object O, include:
  "oc_relation": a short O-C description. If unsure, use "part of".
- For each unit U under each carrier C, use:
  {"unit": "...", "cu_relation": "...", "ou_relation": "..."}
  cu_relation and ou_relation MUST be non-empty.
- For each direct unit U under each object O, use:
  {"unit": "...", "ou_relation": "..."}
  ou_relation MUST be non-empty.

Style examples:

- door/drawer - wardrobe/closet/dresser/nightstand/cabinet: "part of"
- handle - door/drawer: "pull to open or close"
- knob - door/drawer: "turn or pull to open or close"
- switch - table lamp/floor lamp: "turn on or off"
- cap - bottle: "twist to open or close"
- lid - jar: "twist or lift to open or close"
- latch - window: "lock or unlock"
